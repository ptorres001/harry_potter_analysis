# Read Me

In this project, I aim to do a sentiment analysis of each book of Harry Potter to determine the tone. 

This project will include:
* Chapter by chapter analysis
* Graphing the tone progression throughout the length of a book and the series
* Documenting the tone of the beginning, end, and peak climax of the storyline â€” both by book and series
* Analyzing the characters progression and how they were spoken of/reacted to events
